<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Skip the steakhouse and make restaurant-worthy steak at home. Trust us, you're going to want to bookmark this irresistible flat iron steak recipe — you'll come back to it again and again!</p>
<p>Flat iron steak is cut from beef shoulder. To make a flat iron steak, butchers remove the connective tissue to separate the top shoulder blade into two cuts: One is the top blade, the other is the flat iron.

Flat iron steak is nicely marbled and is less expensive than other steaks, which makes it a popular choice among home cooks. When it's cooked correctly, flat iron steak is wonderfully tender and juicy.</p>
